# MyOwnBlockchain
Trying to build my Own Blockchain following an Udemy Mooc

Here is the summary of what has been accomplished so far :

Block Back-end : 

- Set up the overall blockchain application.

- Created the basic building block of the blockchain - with blocks themselves!

- Started a test-driven development approach to the project.

- Built the genesis block - to get the blockchain going.

- Added functionality to mine a block - create a new block for the blockchain.

- Developed the important sha-256 hash function.

- Applied the hash to mine a block.

Chain Back-end :

- Created the fundamental blockchain class.

- Developed functionality to validate the blockchain, to allow for chain replacement.

- Implemented chain replacement.

- Investigated stubbing console output in tests to keep the output clean.
